# My customizations

This theme is a fork-of-a-fork. It's based on [hugo-envisioned](https://github.com/1danjordan/hugo-envisioned), which is based on [hugo-tufte](https://github.com/shawnohare/hugo-tufte).

For now, it's not fully-baked for public consumption. But if you're willing to dig around and figure out my customizations, feel free to use it as you wish. 

Enjoy!
